## Introduction

[reef-pi](http://reef-pi.com) is an opensource [reef tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reef_aquarium) controller based on  [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). This is the software repository
for reef-pi. If you are looking for a build guide use reef-pi [website](http://reef-pi.com). reef-pi development environment setup documentation can be found [here](https://reef-pi.github.io/general-guides/development/)


reef-pi is an [award winning](https://reef-pi.github.io/blogs/makerfaire-2017/), modular, do it yourself (DIY) project that aims to provide a hackable, affordable reef tank automation platform using easy to learn electronics. Apart from Raspberry Pi, reef-pi uses handful of additional electronics boards from [adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/), a open hardware, community focused electronics company. reef-pi is under active development. Follow reef2reef [thread](http://www.reef2reef.com/threads/reef-pi-an-open-source-raspberry-pi-based-reef-tank-controller.289256/) if you want to stay up to date with reef-pi development.
