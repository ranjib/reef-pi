## History

Why an OpenSource Pi based controller?

 - I wanted to learn electronics, go and also build an affordable reef tank.
 Reefer came out of that.
 - Costs less to get started. Raspberry Pi can be used for lot other purposes.
 - Reef-building is an onerous task, with steep learning curve. Yet reef building is one of the most
 rewarding hobbies. With a lot of unknown and lot to learn, an opensource framework might
 help collaboratively learn those things by easy sharing of settings, profiles etc.
 - Customize and extend at will. Given here are a lot more variables
 (size of the tank, type of corals, type of fish, biotopes), reef keeping style may vary a lot.
 - Codifying learnings. Develop sharable reef tank setups
 160G tank builds. That eases the initial and recurring cost and effort estimation.
 - Make it frugal. Easy to build from components with active communities.
 - Add hardware incrementally
 - IoT and smart reef (ability to control all reef tank devices from internet connected devices such as mobile and PC)

There are already a handful of Pi based aquarium controllers. A lot of my ideas
are inspired/borrowed by them or the learning from those discussion threads.


I had always loved fish. Back in India, I had fresh water aquarium multiple times. I started with 12" guppy tank (got it as a gift from one of my uncle when I was 7 year old), Then  a 24x12" gold fish + angel fish  tank. Then 5 tanks, including chiclid, turtle, plant setup during my college days. A saltwater tank was my wish, and a reef was a dream, but I had no idea how to do it or the money. Till I joined industry and got jobs.

I had almost 8 years break for any fish tank. By biocube 29G is my first tank (and a reef tank) after the break.

Coming to USA:
  - Reading and watching reef tanks in LFS. But not able to determine if money and effort is worth.

Learning electronics:
  - Arduino, 3d printer and open hardware.
  - Raspberry Pi, linux & ARM
  - Initial automation suite
  - 3rd printing, fabrication, CNC/Milling.

Chef testing other infrastructure development  using Pi
  - Build farm for everything on Pi.
  - Distributed systems (serf, etcd)
  - Containers, Schedulers (nomad, LXC)
  - go & performance engineering.

Ryan's arrival, reef tank and compex system automation
Ryan my son, was born in Octrober, 2015. With that I started spending lot more time at home. Helping with house chores, while playin with Ryan. I felt building reef tank now makes most sense, as we both could enjoy it. And I can do it in my own pace.
 - Reef tank automation cause its delicate, complex and high stake (fish lives matter)
 - Makerfair and getting inspired to build reefer.
 - Bringing it all together
